Since this repository tends to be something we don't touch for long
stretches of a time before coming back to, here's some tips on common
operations you probably want.

### ADDING A NEW EMACS PACKAGE #########

Add it to the list of packages in `emacs-raw.nix'.

If you're not sure whether the package exists in Nix, you can poke around
in the list of Emacs packages in the REPL:

  $ nix repl

  > sources = import ./nix/sources.nix {}
  > pkgs = import sources.nixpkgs {}
  > pkgs.emacs27Packages  # or whatever version you have
  > builtins.filter (name: name == "purescript-mode")
  >   (builtins.attrNames pkgs.emacs27Packages)

You may need to then add some configuration for your package in `emacs.d/'.

### UPDATING THE CONFIGURATION #########

Do whatever Emacs Lisp-y stuff you need to do inside `emacs.d/'.

If your changes also need some sort of dependency in the Nix store,
modify `emacs-config.nix' to do a substitution.
