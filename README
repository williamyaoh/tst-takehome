My own personal Emacs setup, packaged using Nix.

Unlike a normal Emacs installation, which reads configuration from 
`$HOME/.emacs.d', this setup is completely self-contained; running the
executable produced by the Nix derivation is the only thing needed to
be set up with all the configuration I use.
