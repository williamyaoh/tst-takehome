### Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

The project includes example runners for both the Best Prices and Promotions problems.
You can run them using the following commands:

- `sbt "runMain com.williamyaoh.BestRatesRunner"`
- `sbt "runMain com.williamyaoh.PromotionsRunner"`

The runners will run using the sample data and output the result.

The project also includes a comprehensive unit and PBT test suite that can be
run using `sbt test`.
